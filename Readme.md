# Trusted Computing Paper Reading Hour

This file contains a protocol of all the papers we have read and discussed together as a group. We try to keep it at a two week schedule, but due to some unfortunate events we may move the dates a little bit around.

## Goal

The goal of this reading hour is to make us get better understanding of what we are reading. We try to review the paper as good as possible and discuss our different viewpoints on the paper in our group. We expect the outcome for us to get better at a) reading, b) understanding, c) reviewing, and d) discussions about a certain topic. 

## Interests

Our interests are highly tied to our research fields. We are interested in the following topics:

* Cryptography
* Privacy Enhancing Technologies
* Web Technologies
